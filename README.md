# WinsipediaQuestion3

"Which current FBS school(s) have NEVER played Georgia Tech in football?"

I began combing Winsipedia and Wikipedia, comparing Tech's football record to the current list of FBS teams.  Once I determined there were more than a few teams, I knew there was a better way!

I created a node.js app to scrape two Winsipedia pages (Georgia Tech and All Teams).  Then, I compared the results to each other, revealing the answer.  65 teams in all, including BYU and not including Georgia Tech:
